# LeetCoach

## Inspiration
The idea for LeetCoach came from the need to better prepare developers for technical interviews, where communication and problem-solving under pressure are key. We wanted to create a platform that not only helps users practice coding problems but also improves their ability to articulate their thought process, simulating the high-stakes environment of real interviews.

## What it does
LeetCoach offers mock coding interviews powered by an AI model that interacts with users in real time. The AI simulates an interviewer by asking users to explain their thought process, grilling them on their approach, and providing hints when needed, helping them improve both their coding and communication skills.

## How we built it
We built LeetCoach using a combination of modern tools and technologies. The AI model is integrated with real-time audio processing to create an interactive, conversational experience. We used technologies like GROQ, Cohere for NLP, and Convex for the backend, with Auth0 for authentication, and Google Cloud for speech-to-text transcription.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was integrating real-time audio conversations between the user and the large language model (LLM). Ensuring smooth, low-latency communication while maintaining the quality of the AI's responses was a complex problem that took significant effort to resolve.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of overcoming the technical challenges of integrating real-time conversations. The seamless interaction between users and the AI in mock interview scenarios is a major accomplishment, and it makes LeetCoach a unique and effective tool for interview preparation.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned to work with a range of new APIs and technologies, including GROQ, Cohere for natural language processing, Convex for serverless data handling, Auth0 for secure authentication, and Google Cloud Platform for real-time transcription.

## What's next for LeetCoach
Next, we plan to officially launch the LeetCoach website and scale it into a full-fledged business. Our goal is to offer more features and continually improve the AI to better simulate a real interview experience, helping more users succeed in technical interviews.
